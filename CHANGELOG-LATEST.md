### Added

- The Questlog now reopens to the last opened chapter.
- Saved chapter scroll position when navigating back from a quest or switching chapters.

### Fixed

- Fixed "Hide completed quests" and "Condensed view" display preferences resetting when reopening the Questlog.
- Fixed misleading "Hidden" quest setting tooltip in the editor.
- Fixed the Entity Approach objective in the editor generating a "required_amount" field instead of "range".
- Defaulted missing "range" in Entity Approach objectives to 5 blocks to prevent broken quest errors.
- Fixed the selection list in the quest editor where clicking the scrollbar clicked options underneath it and mouse wheel scrolling was occasionally unresponsive.

## Item tooltips

- Added item tooltips for inline description text and concrete item objectives; no recipe viewer is required.

## Item recipe links

- Added optional EMI/JEI recipe clicks for inline item text and concrete item objectives, controlled by the client openRecipes setting.

## Hover-image validation

- Ignored malformed hover-image IDs/dimensions/animation parameters instead of crashing when quest text is hovered.
